Please refer to the relevant branch according to the Chrome version you need and the chip you have (Intel/ARM ).  
For ARM look for (selneium version).x-(chrome version)-arm.  
For Intel look for (selneium version).x-(chrome version). 

Follow the readme in each branch for the build and run instructions.
